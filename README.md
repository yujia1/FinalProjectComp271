Abstract:
The goal of this project is to create an app which will display multiple phonebooks, which contains information about contact name, phone number, categories(School, Company, Emergency, Restaurant), and cities(Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago). Additionally, this phone book will be presented in form of graphic. We design graphic of the phone book that contains features including save, add, remove, and search. Along with these feature, users are able to manipulate phone book information. Moreover, we also add some features about set up cities and categories. Users can use these functions to set up contact information. 

We will be using multiple data structures for this project, including binary search, merge sort, recursion, and arraylist. 
Figures:

Figure 1. When the user opens the app, they will see default list of contact, text files where users can input contact information. 


Figure 2. When users select contact in list and click buttons of city section where contains Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago, contact information about city would update to city accordingly. Similarly, when users use category section buttons, contact information would be updated accordingly.


Figure 3. When users select contact in list, users can click buttons on functionality section where contains save, add, delete, and search fucntions. By these functions, users can achieve corresponding functions.

Project Design:
We will be using IntelliJ’s Android Studio plugin to create the app.

Our project will be different from this one because it will return all cases that contain the substring that the user searches for, whereas this code simply returns “name not found”.

Our project is different from the ones listed because it will be an android application that will open and will have different features based on cities and what you need to look for.
